# Slideshow for ArduinoCade

I'm doing a slideshow (demoscene) for the minimalist video game Arduinocade.

I have created a kind of simulator in HTML5, which allows to see the images from any web browser.

This intermediate tool allows to see the demo, without lack of arduinocade. I will also publish the version generated for ATMEGA328.

The images used are not my own, but I have used those of other artists sceners, converted by another tool to arduinocade compatible format. It has been necessary to modify the pixels of many images, since only 256 sprites and 40x24 tiles with a resolution of 160x192 pixels are available.
